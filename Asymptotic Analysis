Asymptotic Analysis is defined as the big idea that handles the above issues in analyzing algorithms. In Asymptotic Analysis, we evaluate the performance of an algorithm in terms of input size (we donâ€™t measure the actual running time). We calculate, how the time (or space) taken by an algorithm increases with the input size.
